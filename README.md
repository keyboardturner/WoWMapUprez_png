This probably isn't the project you're looking for. This merely acts as a viewable source for the [WoW Map Uprez](https://github.com/keyboardturner/WoWMapUprez) and [WoW Map Uprez Classic](https://github.com/keyboardturner/WoWMapUprezClassic) projects, as the real projects are in [blp format](https://wow.gamepedia.com/BLP_files). __If you download this thinking you'll be replacing your WoW map files, you'll be sorely mistaken.__
